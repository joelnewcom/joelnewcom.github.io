#### [Cloud](/cloud)
As I am working now with Azure I will document my learning here.  

#### [Tools and Frameworks](/tools-frameworks)
Every tool I walk over becomes a special place here. As a software engineer there is almost no way around: Docker, ElasticSearch, Maven, Linux, you name it. 

#### [Software project](/software-project) 
This is the place for non-technical wisdom. Methodologies, soft-skills, how to pitch and so on.

#### [Software engineering](/software-engineering)
Notes about programming languages, technical stuff I should remember for next projects.
