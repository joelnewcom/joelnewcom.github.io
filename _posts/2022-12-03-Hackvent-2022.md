# [HV22.01] QR means quick reactions, right?
You can download a QR code gif. The qr code is changing so fast you won't be able to scan it.

I pasted it into https://safeimagekit.com/download?tool=Gif%20extractor which generates me this:

Each QR code is a letter of the flag. 

I scanned each image with my phone. That was pain in the ass. Had issues with I and l and _ and -. 

# [HV22.02] Santa's song
In this picture there is a number password hidden:

# [HV22.03] gh0st
There is a python script given 

It takes an input string "flag" and xors it with a song (string). 
The encrypted message is also given (variable "correct")

```
correct = [17, 55, 18, 92, 91, 10, 38, 8, 76, 127, 17, 12, 17, 2, 20, 49, 3, 4, 16, 8, 3, 58, 67, 60, 10, 66, 31, 95, 1, 93]
for i,c in enumerate(flag):
    flag[i] ^= ord(song[i*10 % len(song)])
```

First attempt is to try the ascii table for each letter:
```
bruteforced = [0] * 30
for i in range (30):
    for asciiCount in range(127):
        if (asciiCount ^ ord(song[i*10 % len(song)]) == correct[i]):
            bruteforced[i] = asciiCount
print(list(map(chr, bruteforced)))
``` 

This gave me the flag.
