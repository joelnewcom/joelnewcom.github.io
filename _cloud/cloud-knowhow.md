### cloud

## public cloud
Is hosted by a cloudprovider like azure and you will normally share resources with others.

## private cloud
You host a cloud yourself. You provide the hardware and run it as a cloud.
This scenario should be used if your environment needs special restrictions (sensitive data)

## hybrid cloud
You use both, private and public cloud together.

## multi cloud
You use different cloud providers.

## cloud services
