# Task #1 Introduction
Read through the awesomes prices and notice how each task gets also a walkthrough of famous cyber security streamers.
 Click "Completed" and task is done. 
 
# Task #2 Short Tutorial & Rules
There is a link to a tutorial how to connect via open VPN into your tryhack me room network.
I did the tutorial by running my ParrotOS within virtualBox and open tryhackme in the browser there.
You need to download a .ovpn file and start it with: ```sudo openvpn Desktop/saywhatagain.ovpn```
Then you would need to start the target machine. Its IP address is printed on the page and you only need to 
put the IP into the browsers addressbar and you get the flag.
