This task was an explanation of attack vector and attack surface. 

# Attack vector
Is the weapon a hacker might use like:  

* Phishing emails; Deceptive emails that are often impersonating someone and asking the victim to perform an action that compromises their security.
* Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks; Sending so many requests to a website or web application that it reaches its limits and can no longer serve legitimate requests.
* Web drive-by attacks; Flaws in web browsers that compromise the security of the victim by merely visiting a website.
* Unpatched Vulnerability exploitation; A flaw in the internet-facing infrastructure, such as the web server or the network interface, that is exploited to take control of the infrastructure.

# Attack surface
Is the area which is suspect of an attack, like: 

* An email server that is used for sending and receiving emails.
* An internet-facing web server that serves a website to visitors.
* End-user machines that people use to connect to the network.
* Humans can be manipulated and tricked into giving control of the network to an attacker through social engineering.
