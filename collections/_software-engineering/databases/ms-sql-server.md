# Fresh installation
To work with MS SQL database locally, the easiest way is to run SQL Server 2019 Express or SQL Server 2019 Developer edition locally.
The installation requires admin access and the user used to install the server will be the database server admin.

Once installed you can connect to the database with SQL server management studio via the admin credential used to install the sql server.

# Provide access rights to other users
Then click on "Security" -> "Logins" -> "BUILTIN\Users" (In German: "Vordefiniert\Users")

and provide needed access to all windows logins. This is obviously only for developing purposes.

# Am I sysadmin?
To check if your current account has admin priviledge run: 
```
SELECT name,type_desc,is_disabled, create_date
FROM master.sys.server_principals
WHERE IS_SRVROLEMEMBER ('sysadmin',name) = 1
ORDER BY name
```

Or use more sophisticated query:
```
USE master
GO
SELECT DISTINCT p.name AS [loginname] ,
p.type ,
p.type_desc ,
p.is_disabled,
s.sysadmin,
CONVERT(VARCHAR(10),p.create_date ,101) AS [created],
CONVERT(VARCHAR(10),p.modify_date , 101) AS [update]
FROM sys.server_principals p
JOIN sys.syslogins s ON p.sid = s.sid
JOIN sys.server_permissions sp ON p.principal_id = sp.grantee_principal_id
WHERE p.type_desc IN ('SQL_LOGIN', 'WINDOWS_LOGIN', 'WINDOWS_GROUP')
/**â€” Logins that are not process logins **/
AND p.name NOT LIKE '##%'
/** Logins that are sysadmins or have GRANT CONTROL SERVER **/
AND (s.sysadmin = 1 OR sp.permission_name = 'CONTROL SERVER')
ORDER BY p.name
GO
```

Thats how it looks like when you have sys-admin access:

Thats how it looks like if you don't have sys-admin access:
