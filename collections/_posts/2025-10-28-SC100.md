# SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect
https://aka.ms/courseSC-100

# Day 1
## Zero Trust Security
Core principle: Always verify, least privilege, assume breach.

6 pillars of Zero Trust

 - Identity
 - Endpoints
 - Network
 - Applications
 - Data
 - Infrastructure

Zero trust is a journey, not a product; no single tool can “enable” it.

## Frameworks
* Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF): Guides cloud migration, including strategy, planning, readiness, and adoption. Landing zones are critical for scalable, secure cloud environments.
* Well-Architected Framework (WAF): Focuses on reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency. Trade-offs between pillars discussed.
* Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA): Comprehensive reference library for security design, including anti-patterns, tool mapping, and modernization strategies. https://aka.ms/MCRA
* Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB): Prioritized security controls for Azure and multi-cloud, mapped to industry standards. https://aka.ms/mcsb

## Risk Management & Best Practices
Risk assessment: Impact vs. likelihood, not all risks can or should be eliminated.
Importance of patching, balancing operational and security risks.
Anti-patterns: Documented in the Cloud Adoption Framework, but not exhaustive.

## Technical Tools & Operations
Azure Advisor: Provides recommendations aligned with the Well-Architected Framework.
Landing zones: Templates and deployment scripts available for scalable Azure environments.
SIEM/SOAR: Sentinel, Defender XDR, and integration with MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/) for incident detection and response.

## Ransomware & Resilience
Modern ransomware attacks involve both encryption and data exfiltration/extortion.
Defense: Immutable backups, data classification, encryption, and incident response planning.
Business continuity: Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are key metrics.
