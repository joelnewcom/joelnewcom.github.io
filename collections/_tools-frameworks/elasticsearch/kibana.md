# Search in Kibana
You can type into the search bar something like: ````log.level: "ERROR" and not message: "Self registration failed"````


# Ignored fields
You cannot search for fields that are ignored in the index pattern.
If a field is ignored, you can see this yellowish warning sign in the field list.
