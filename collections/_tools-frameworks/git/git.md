I know three types of branching model for git. 

* [Git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
* [Trunk based](https://paulhammant.com/2013/04/05/what-is-trunk-based-development/)
* [Environment Branching](https://sairamkrish.medium.com/git-branching-strategy-for-true-continuous-delivery-eade4435b57e)

[Good comparison between the strategies](https://www.toptal.com/software/trunk-based-development-git-flow)
