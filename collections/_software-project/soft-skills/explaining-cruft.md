### internal versus external quality
Explain that you talk about internal quality. Its most of the time not visible on the frontend. Its the developer who needs to cope with all this.

Internal quality
* Module structure
* Software architecture (MVVN)
* Software design (SOLID, yagni etc.)
* Tests

External quality
* What the customer currently sees and feels

### Cruft
(In german überflüssiger Müll / nutzloser Code)
