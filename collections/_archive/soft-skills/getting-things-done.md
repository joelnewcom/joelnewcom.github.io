* Create different buckets on MS Planer. For example: Two buckets for each project you are working on: {Projectname}/Tasks and {ProjectName}/WaitingFor
* Create a "Processed" folder in Outlook. As soon as you read an email move it into this folder or directly to trash to keep the inbox clean.
* Create an "Inbox" Notes page on OneNote. It is for temporary notes and acts also as Inbox for tasks. You should clean this everyday.
