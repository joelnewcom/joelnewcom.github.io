# career coaching

In 2023, I got the privilege to work with a personal coach on my career.

## Key outcomes
When I can do following things at my workplace, I am happy: 

- Colleagues appreciate me for who I am and what I do.
- I enjoy tinkering with new solutions and creating things that haven't existed before. I also enjoy working on projects that others may have given up on.
- I love working with talented individuals from whom I can learn. We discuss software craftsmanship and grow together.
- Together, we explore new approaches and technologies, and celebrate when we achieve improvements.
- I enjoy being challenged by new projects, new approaches, and new wisdom.

I will always feel the urge to write software. I don't want to lose grip on this craftsmanship, and I want to be part of the group that creates the software, I want to have the power to change things and not just order them from someone else.
