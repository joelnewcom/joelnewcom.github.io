# Death
In my case its easy. As I am married, social insurance goes to my wife:

* 3th pillar goes automatically to my wife
* 2th pillar goes to wife and children
* 1th pillar, by law, the widow gets "Hinterlassenenrente" (min. 980 CHF and max. 1'960 CHF per month)

# Invalidity
- What happens when you cannot work anymore?
- How and how long does your company or government help you?

The time factor is key here. If you recover within days or weeks, you are most probably covered by 100%. 
Though it might anyway not be a big problem in the first place, as you earn money soon anyway.

## gaps
The first gap comes after being sick for over 3 weeks, when KTG sets in. KTG only pays you 80% of your salary. 
The gap opens bigger after being sick for over 2 years. Because then the Krankentaggeld insurance stops and IV and pension steps in (60% of your salary)

Krankentaggeld (KTG) => Lohnausfall (Loss of salary)

## Sickness

  * Then IV and pension takes over (Should be about 60% of your salary)

## Accident insurance
By law (UVG), if you work weekly at least 8h for the same (swiss) company, you are insured against accidents.
