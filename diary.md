## My tale of becoming a craftsman
*// 18.03.2020*

#### New project
I worked from 2016 to 2020 as a software engineer in a financial software company. I had the privilege to work on a green field project as a junior software engineer.
The business unit had a great idea where the company could start a totally new business.
The idea was pretty simple: We want to provide a platform where financial institutes can meet with regulatory data. The platform will support a lot of different regulations templates, handle a huge amount of data and store for a long time for a potential audit.

#### Pressure and fun
There was a big pressure since the beginning of the project to a specific date. An important european regulatory went active beginning of 2018 and we needed to be ready in production at latest this date. Otherwise our customers could be fined by the regulator.
Nevertheless it was big fun. Colleagues were awesome. We discovered new technologies and made a lot of POCs. The GUI looked awesome and the business like us. It seemed everything is possible and we developers are the kings.
We thought, as long as we were compliant with agile manifesto, we were fine. At a certain point it was even true. At the end we actually went live and achieved our target.

> * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> * Working software over comprehensive documentation
> * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> * Responding to change over following a plan

#### Decisions were made 
We agreed on using a special kind of key-value-database and decoupled the whole input process from the base application into an own component. We all agreed on having a REST API between these two components.
For every decision we made it was important that a senior developer gave his OK to it. As long as the decision was made from someone "high" everybody agreed to it.
We decided to use xml based spring bean configuration and use camel as framework for our data-intake component. At this time all these decisions seemed right to me. I actually never questioned them or even supported them.

#### Curve goes down
The project was not new anymore. Developers around the world were coming and going. They could basically do whatever they want. There was no design to follow, there was no quality gate to fulfill. There was no level of code maturity to hold. 
We somehow slowed down. Discussions got longer and the same topics came back over and over again.
The management granted us time to work on our technical debt stories and even provided us a real scrum master as our team was not able to organize itself anymore. It did help. It helped the team to act as a team and we really tried to make our software better.
But we were not able to do so.

#### Which fault is it? 
 
#### the craftsman, the journeyman
The project was two years old and a new guy joined the team. By this time I wasn't a junior anymore
