### My personal tech notes
#### [Cloud](cloud/index.md)
As I am working now with Azure I will document my learning here.  

#### [Tools and Frameworks](tools-frameworks/index.md)
Every tool I walk over becomes a special place here. As a software engineer there is almost no way around: Docker, ElasticSearch, Maven, Linux, you name it. 

#### [Software project](software-project/index.md) 
This is the place for non-technical wisdom. Methodologies, soft-skills, how to pitch and so on.

#### [Software engineering](software-engineering/index.md)
Notes about programming languages, technical stuff I should remember for next projects.

#### [Diary entries](craftsmanship)
My diary about projects I worked on, books a read and what else bothers me.
