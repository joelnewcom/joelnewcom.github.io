# Time 
## Calendar
If you want to create a meeting for only reminding purpose (like: UAT not available during this time period), 
or to show you are on vacation, you should configure the meeting as "free-time", so it doesn't block the time for your friend for actual meetings.

## 12 hours clock am/pm
Its not always clear how to represent the start and end of a day with 12hours format. To prevent confusion NIST defined it like this:
Start of the day: 12:01 am
End of the day: 11:59 pm

| 12-hour                                                      | 24-hour |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------| 
| Midnight (start of day) <br /> 12 midnight <br /> 12:00 a.m. | 	00:00 |
| 12:01 a.m.                                                   | 	00:01 |
| 01:00 a.m.                                                   | 	01:00 |
| 11:00 a.m.                                                   | 	11:00 |
| 11:59 a.m.                                                   | 	11:59 |

# Effects and laws to describe a standard situation

## Conway's law
This law says an enterprise architecture (how we slice our components) converges with the internal structure of the company's staff
  
## Dunning-kruger effect
This effect says people with low abilities overestimate their abilities and people with high abilities underestimate their abilities. 

# Leading
## Blaming
When there is someone exposed like a project-leader it is super easy to blame him/her and talk bad about their way of leading. 
People want to remove him/her because they think someone else or even themselves can do it much better. 
In a lot of cases we also assume the leader have hidden agendas or just lying about stuff. 

In all cases where the leadership actually changed, I took the chance to talk privately with them and we could speak 
very openly about the past times. To my surprise it always turns out that they just did their job and tried their best
to hold multiple groups (with different ambitions) together.
