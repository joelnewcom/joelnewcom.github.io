# time 
## Calendar
If you want to create a meeting for only reminding purpose (like: UAT not available during this time period), 
or to show you are on vacation, you should configure the meeting as "free-time", so it doesn't block the time for your friend for actual meetings.

## 12 hours clock am/pm
Its not always clear how to represent the start and end of a day with 12hours format. To prevent confusion NIST defined it like this:
Start of the day: 12:01 am
End of the day: 11:59 pm

|---------- | --------| 
|Midnight (start of day) <br /> 12 midnight <br /> 12:00 a.m. |	00:00 |
|12:01 a.m. |	00:01 |
| 1:00 a.m. |	01:00 |
